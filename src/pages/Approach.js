          The ancients knew the power of the{" "}
          <strong>mind, body and the breath</strong>, and modern research is
          proving what they knew; you have the capacity to{" "}
          <strong>transform yourself from the inside out.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not a quick fix. The process asks you to release the familiar
          and <strong>step into the unknown</strong>.  It takes{" "}
          <strong>courage</strong> to risk letting go of what no longer works
          for you.  Holding a clear space of enquiry allows you to see your
          patterns, identify blind spots and{" "}
          <strong>unlock your potential</strong>.  Greater self-awareness
          equates with <strong>greater freedom</strong>.  Through this work you
          learn where you have agency and find your way through the blocks.

          I am dual qualified as a <strong>Coach and Yoga Teacher</strong>. I'm
          fascinated with how the body, mind and breath work{" "}
          <strong>together</strong> and how listening deeply{" "}
          <strong>opens us to new dimensions</strong> of experience and personal
          growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I draw on tools, techniques and teachings from different traditions
          and cultures and am grateful to all my teachers, peers and
          communities.   I recognise that ultimately all paths lead to the same
          destination, <strong>all rivers flow to the sea.</strong>
