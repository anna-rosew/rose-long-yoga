          <p>
            I've been teaching and facilitating groups since my mid-twenties.
            Initially, I trained as a secondary school teacher in Religious
            Education. However, I quickly realized that I didn’t enjoy the
            school system any longer as a teacher. This realization prompted me
            to move into Human Rights Education, where I set up the Education
            Department at Anti-Slavery International. During my time there, I
            had the privilege of working with remarkable individuals and
            community organizations both in the British Isles and beyond.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my early thirties, inspired by the work of Paulo Freire, I
            co-founded and directed Living Lens, an international social
            enterprise. Through Living Lens, I ran projects that used video as a
            tool to facilitate communication and collaboration. In today’s world
            of mass media, where a limited number of narratives dominate, these
            projects provided a platform for marginalized voices to cultivate
            new conversations at local, national, and international levels,
            ultimately generating positive social change
          </p>
          <p>
            During this period, I also trained as a Self-Expression and
            Leadership Coach. I became fascinated by the potential for learning,
            healing, and growth that can be unlocked through embodied coaching
            conversations. This interest led me to further training in my early
            forties, where I became a Holistic Health Coach and Yoga Teacher.
            Despite all my experiences and training, I consider myself a work in
            progress!
